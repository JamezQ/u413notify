I'm not much of a readme guy, but here goes..

You need to be running any *nix os that has notify-osd, although it can work without it, it will then just print out the notifications to the terminal.

You need to put beautiful soup in the same directory, get it by downloading it from this git repo.

That is all, help keep u413 active by knowing when people join the chat!.

Maybe pimaster will make this run on windows one day, who knows?
